                  in Indonesia held annually by ITS Information Systems Student Association. In this event there is 
                  a sub-event named ICON or the extention of it is IT Convention, is a series event to give enlightenment and provides
                  knowledge about issues that related around IT at this time. At this moment on this event, i have the responsiblity
                  as a Staff to make this things work eventually such as helping each other Staff to finish their job, responsible to make
                  sure that the series of event we hold with our Expert Staff is well prepared and ready to launch, etc.

              <h3>Undergraduate Student</h3>
              <p>
                  I'm an undergraduate student in Sepuluh Nopember Technolohy Institute rigth now and i think i at this time
                  i can call my self a college student. I went to this institute and i choose to study at Information System Departement
                  because i think i can consider my sefl as a tech kind of guy and i really like and passionete about how to become a
                  businessman in this digital era so i think this Departement can suite me pretty well.

              <h3>Part Time Worker, Full Time Learner</h3>
              <p>
                  I also work at my family business right now and that is a food culinary business. So basiclly this is a simple business
                  where my mother cooks some food as what the people ordered to her, and my job is to promote it and deliver it. I know it's 
                  kind of simple job but i think i'm still part of this business. But most of my time i spent it to learn something that i haven't 
                  master it yet, because for me, learning is a never ending journey and people will always need to learn something new in their life
                  no matter how important no matter how trivial it is people will always need to learn to make a better life.
